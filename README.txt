Hello! Thanks for downloading the DLCZ Plugin.

Here is a sample of what this plugin will look like as a widget in a 
sidebar (check the widget labeled "Testimony")->https://phoenix.sheridanc.on.ca/~ccit3663/?page_id=9

Here is a sample of what the plugin's shortcode will look like
in your website (check the shortcode labeled "Get in Touch!")-> https://phoenix.sheridanc.on.ca/~ccit3663/?page_id=2


INSTRUCTIONS:
Once the plugin is downloaded, installed, and activated in your website, the plugin will let you do the following:
		
				- (A) Add a Testimony that appears in a form of a widget
				- (B) Add social media links to your website

			I will discuss each feature into two sections. 

-------------------------------------------------------
			Section A: Testimony Widget
-------------------------------------------------------
(A) Testimony can help endorse your character beyond what's seen in your skills. You can do the following to create a testimony
	that can be seen in your website's widget area

	1. Add a testimony by going to your Dashboard > Testimony
	2. Like publishing a new post, press add new, which brings you to the editor that lets you add text and featured images
	3. Instead of a title, write the person's name who gave you a testimony that endorses you
	4. Then, add the testimony in the main text section
	5. Add a featured image to your testimony. This image can be a portrait of the person giving the testimony or a photo 
		of the project that you worked on together
	6. Press Publish when done.
	7. Next, go to Dashboard > Appearance > Widgets
	8. Find the DLCZ widget and drag it to the area where you want that widget to appear.
	9. Once in the widget area, click DLCZ and you'll find a dropdown area where you can select if you want to show a specific post
			or if you want the widget to show the most recent testimony. Choose what you prefer a potential employer to see. 
	10. Press Save when done. Check your website's sidebar if you are satisfied with what you see. 

-------------------------------------------------------
			Section B: Social Media Icons 
-------------------------------------------------------			
(B) Create social media icons that link to your Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, and Google Plus. Use this opportunity
		 to add your professional accounts to your website. You can add this feature to a post or page. 

	1. To add the social media icons, edit or create a post/page where you want the social media icons to appear.
	2. In the area where you want to place the new social media icons in your  post/page, place the following short text:

		[socialmedia fb_link="" twitter_link="" linkedin_link="" googleplus_link=""]
		
			NOTE: Inside the quotation marks, add the link to your social media accounts
		
	3. Press update/publish, then check if the socialmedia icons are formed.
	4. If you want to change the social media icons' color scheme, icon size, and the heading of the social media icons, replace step 2's short text 
			with the following and add relevant information inside the quotation marks:
	
			[socialmedia fb_link="" twitter_link="" linkedin_link="" googleplus_link="" iconcolor="" iconhover="" size="" label="" labelcolor=""]
					
		NOTE 	These are the keyterms from step 4's short text: 
					- iconcolor refers to the social media icons' color
					- iconhover refers to the social media icons' color when the mouse hovers over the icon
					- size refers to the size of the social media icons
					- label refers to the heading that is above the social media icons
					- labelcolor refers to the color of the heading that is above the social media icons
		
	5. After placing the short text from step 4, insert the desired color inside the quotation marks of step 4's short text.
		I recommend using hex colors (see: http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp).
	6. Once you've made your preferred customizations, update the post and check the social media icons in the area where you added the icons.
	7. If you're not satisfied with the button's color scheme, edit the post again and change the information inside
		the quotation marks of step 4's short text--repeat until satisfied.
